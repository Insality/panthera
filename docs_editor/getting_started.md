# Important Notes

Here are some fast helpful tips and reminders for using Panthera Editor:

- To create animation you have to create a layout with nodes in **Layout mode** (or export GUI layout from **[Defold](https://defold.com/)** project).
- Then layout created, you can switch to **Animation mode** and start making animations.
- Pan the editor view by holding `Ctrl` or `Alt` and dragging the view.
- Property names in ðŸ”¸ orange indicate unapplied changes. ![changed_property](/docs_editor/media/icon_changed_property.png)
- Click on **ðŸ”¸ Orange Property Name** to apply changes.
- Unapplied changes will not be animated in the preview until they are saved or discarded.
- Right Click on the **Property Name** to show the context menu (contains Discard Changes).
- Two buttons in the Properties panel: ![icon_commit](/docs_editor/media/icon_commit_all.png) **"Commit All Changes"** and ![icon_reset](/docs_editor/media/icon_reset_all.png) **"Reset All Changes"**.
- Node names in ðŸ”¸ orange indicate nodes with unapplied changes.
- Node names in **bold** indicate nodes with timeline keys.
- Animation names in **bold** indicate animations with timeline keys.
- Animations can contains timeline keys _(select the animation in the Animations panel to view them)_.
- Select timeline keys to edit them.
- Use the ðŸ”¸ **Gizmo** to move and stretch selected timeline keys.
- Move keys by dragging the ðŸ”¸ square at the middle of the selection.
- Animation timeline keys can start other animations (don't cycle them! ;) ).
- Keep your animation files under version control to avoid losing your work.
- Hit `Ctrl` + `S` to save the project file.
- Toggle Editor Gizmo visible state with `W` key.

## Animation Initial State

https://github.com/Insality/panthera/assets/3294627/d9654d70-d82a-4b47-9e6a-b3b6c903333b

The animation's initial state by default is the layout state. However, you can choose a different animation to set as the initial state via the Properties panel. In this case, the chosen animation's end state will be used as the initial state.

1. Select the animation in the Animations panel.
2. Choose the initial state animation in the Properties panel.

To reset the initial state, set the initial state animation to `Initial Layout`.

## Animation Preview

You can adjust the animation preview speed and zoom in the Timeline panel. These settings are only for preview and will not be exported.


# Export Animation Data

https://github.com/Insality/panthera/assets/3294627/867e4116-2015-4de8-ad3b-b464bbdca50a

<!-- File used in Panthera editor is the same for runtime -->

Panthera Editor used a JSON file for animation data. This file serves a dual purpose: it is used directly within the editor for creating and modifying animations, and it is also read by the runtime to display the animations. There is no separate export process; the runtime uses the same JSON file that the editor uses.

## How to Find Animation File

1. Right click on the project in the Projects tab or in the Project List.
2. Select "Show in Desktop".

The file will be opened in the file explorer window.

# Import Defold GUI Layout
<!-- animation file should be placed inside your Defold Project folder -->

https://github.com/Insality/panthera/assets/3294627/ed082b26-cfaf-4567-93ac-41d2169b2444

You can import the Defold GUI layout to the Panthera Editor. The animation file should be placed inside your Defold project folder to correct reloading in the future.

1. Open animation project.
2. Click on the plus icon in the Nodes panel.
3. Select "Bind Defold File".
4. Choose the `.gui` file from your Defold project.

The GUI layout will be imported and displayed in the Editor View. The file state is changed to linked. The GUI will be reloaded automatically when the project is opened, or manually by clicking the "Reload Binded File" button.

The layout nodes can't be modified. But you can animate them. Nodes layout data will be not stored in the animation file. Only the animation data will be stored.


# Working with Node Properties

# Panthera 2.0 Editor

**Panthera 2.0 Editor** is a cross-platform animation software developed using the [Defold](https://defold.com/) engine and [Druid UI framework](https://github.com/Insality/druid). **Panthera 2.0** is tightly integrated with **Defold**, allowing you to create animations for your Defold projects with ease.

Defold integration allows you to start create animations directly from the Defold Editor, supporting to import your existing GUI and Collection files.


## Features

- **üöÄ One-Click Defold Integration** - Right-click any GUI/Collection/GO file in Defold Editor ‚Üí Create Panthera Animation ‚Üí Start animating immediately. Zero setup, zero file conversion needed.

- **‚ö° Live Timeline Editor** - Create animation keys for any property (position, rotation, scale, color) with precise timing, easing curves, and real-time preview.

- **üéØ Template Animations** - Reuse animations from your GUI templates and collection files which is already created or create new animation files for these templates directly from the **Panthera 2.0 Editor**.

- **üé® Intuitive Interface** - Simple and easy to use interface with a focus on creating animations quickly and efficiently. I put a lot of effort to make the interface as simple as possible.

- **üì¶ Lightweight & Fast** - Tiny editor download under 10MB. Runs smoothly on any modern computer without any dependencies or bloated installation.

- **üåü Standalone Flexibility** - While built specifically for Defold, can be used independently or adapted for other game engines. Create layouts manually inside Panthera for non-Defold projects _(custom runtime implementation required)_.

# Panthera 2.0 Editor

**Panthera 2.0 Editor** is a cross-platform animation software solution developed using the [Defold](https://defold.com/) engine, with the goal of streamlining the process of designing layouts and animations for game projects.

Integrated tightly with Defold, Panthera allows the import of `.gui` files, which can then be animated directly within the editor interface. This tool offers support for various animation techniques, including tweening, triggering, events, and animation keys, allowing users to create complex animations effortlessly.

**Panthera 2.0 Editor** uses a simple animation [JSON format](/docs_editor/animation_data_format.md) for animation files. If you are not using Defold, the animation runtime can be easily implemented in any game engine or framework.

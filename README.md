# Panthera Runtime

**Panthera Runtime** - a [Defold](https://defold.com/) library designed to integrate animations created with [**Panthera 2.0 Editor**](/docs_editor/README.md), seamlessly integrate **Panthera 2.0** animations into your Defold projects. This runtime can play animation for Game Objects and GUI nodes with a also a animation cursor support.

## Features

- **Seamless Integration**: Import and use **Panthera 2.0** directly in Defold with one click.
- **Full Animation Support**: Supports all animation features provided by **Panthera 2.0**, including events, nested animations, all available properties and more.
- **Flexible Usage**: Compatible with both Game Objects and GUI nodes in Defold, allowing for flexible usage across different game elements.
- **Animation Cursor**: Provides a way to control animation manually, allowing for precise control over playback and synchronization with game events.

## Panthera 2.0 Editor

Read the [**Panthera 2.0 Editor**](/docs_editor/README.md) guide to learn about the **Panthera 2.0 Editor**. This is the animation editor that you can use to create animations for your Defold projects, created with [Defold engine](https://defold.com/) and [Druid UI framework](https://github.com/Insality/druid)!

## Setup

### [Dependency](https://defold.com/manuals/libraries/#setting-up-library-dependencies)

Open your `game.project` file and add the following lines to the dependencies field under the project section:


**[Defold Tweener](https://github.com/Insality/defold-tweener)**

```
https://github.com/Insality/defold-tweener/archive/refs/tags/3.zip
```

**[Panthera Runtime](https://github.com/Insality/panthera)**

```
https://github.com/Insality/panthera/archive/refs/tags/runtime.4.zip
```

After that, select `Project ‚ñ∏ Fetch Libraries` to update [library dependencies]((https://defold.com/manuals/libraries/#setting-up-library-dependencies)). This happens automatically whenever you open a project so you will only need to do this if the dependencies change without re-opening the project.
